Part 1 - SQL Questions
1. Explore Clinical and Genomics Tables
2. Find all patients that are alive and have a 'AKT1' or 'TP53' mutation
3. Count the number of patients with each type of cancer (Histology)
4. Find the age distribution for patients with stage 3 or higher
5. What is the most prevalent genomic mutation?
6. What is the longest average survival in months and years?
7. Write a query that would find and delete duplicate IDs assuming they exist.
8. Write a query transaction that will change stage to III for patients who are alive, have Adenocarcinoma and a tumor size greater than 2.

-- Question 2
SELECT clinical.*
FROM clinical
JOIN genomics ON clinical.c1 = genomics.c1
WHERE clinical.c2 = 'Alive'
  AND (genomics.c2 = 'AKT1' OR genomics.c2 = 'TP53_Col1' OR genomics.c2 = 'TP53_Col2');
  
-- Question 3
SELECT c13, COUNT(*) 
FROM clinical
GROUP BY c13

-- Question 4
SELECT stage_roman, MIN(c4) AS min_age, MAX(c4) AS max_age
FROM (
  SELECT
    c11 AS stage_roman,

      WHEN c11 LIKE 'IIIA' THEN '3A'

    END AS stage_arabic,

) AS stage_conversion
WHERE stage_arabic >= 3
GROUP BY stage_roman

-- Question 5
SELECT c2, COUNT(*) AS mutation_count
FROM genomics
GROUP BY c2
ORDER BY mutation_count DESC
LIMIT 1;

-- Question 6
SELECT
  AVG(c3) AS avg_survival_months
  -- FLOOR(AVG(survival_months) / 12) AS avg_survival_years,
FROM clinical
ORDER BY avg_survival_months DESC
LIMIT 1;

-- Question 7
WITH DuplicateIDs AS (
  SELECT c1
  FROM clinical
  GROUP BY c1
  HAVING COUNT(c1) > 1
)
DELETE FROM clinical
WHERE c1 IN (SELECT c1 FROM DuplicateIDs);

-- Question 8
UPDATE clinical
SET c11 = 'III'
WHERE clinical.c2 = 'Alive' 
  AND c13 = 'Adenocarcinoma' 
  AND c14 > 2;
